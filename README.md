# Maze-generation
This project was developed as part of Northeastern's Fundamentals of Computer Science II class during the Spring of 2024

# Logistics
The goal of this assignment was to generate a random perfect maze using Kruskal's algorithm, and then implement Breadth-First Search and Depth-First Search algorithms respectively. In the project, we were able to add the following features: 
* Animate the maze generation process
* Generate a horizontally biased maze
* Generate a vertically biased maze
* Have the player navigate the maze
* Shows how many incorrect moves the player or the search algorithm had made
* have the player choose a searching algorithm (either bfs or dfs) and then animates the algorithm
* have the player regenerate a new maze
