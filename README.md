# Maze-generation
This project was developed as part of Northeastern's Fundamentals of Computer Science II class during the Spring of 2024

# Logistics
The goal of this assignment was to generate a random perfect maze using [Kruskal's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%27s_algorithm), and then implement [Breadth-First Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) and [Depth-First Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search) algorithms respectively. In the project, we were able to add the following features: 
* Animate the maze generation process
* Generate a horizontally biased maze
* Generate a vertically biased maze
* Have the player navigate the maze
* Shows how many incorrect moves the player or the search algorithm had made
* have the player choose a searching algorithm (either bfs or dfs) and then animates the algorithm
* have the player regenerate a new maze
* Players can toggle between seeing and not seeing thier visited paths
* Players can also toggle to see a gradient of how far each cell is from either the end of the maze or the beginning of the maze
